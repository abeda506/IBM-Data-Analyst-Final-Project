# IBM-Data-Analyst-Final-Project
The report is a comparative analysis of Present-Day dominance and future popularity. It is about various aspects of software developers covering topics like programming languages, development practices, frameworks, salaries, job preferences, demographic information, and job satisfaction. The major stakeholders are developers, tech Companies, Recruiters, Researchers, Analysts, Tech Enthusiasts, and Students. Datasets are collected from Kaggle. Two datasets were taken for analysis "m5_survey_data_demographics.csv" and "m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv."  Jupyter Notebook is used to code the data. Before analysis data is cleaned by using some codes to avoid duplicates and missing numbers. After data cleaning, the next step is to showcase the five programming languages for the current and future years. At present JavaScript language is very popular but it is predicted Python will be taken up the first position. After that, database trends are shown, as their future predictability. It is concluded that as programming languages evolve rapidly, Python is positioned to become one of the best languages among IT professionals and developers due to its versatile applications, including web development, data analysis, and machine learning. Python is expected to play a significant role in the evolving IT industry, contributing to significant changes in the field.
